        	The extensive applications of electronic devices and systems play a vital role in the development of the socio-economic growth of the country. It is the field where the world's best talent meets the most, creative ideas are most active, and competitiveness for inventions is fiercest. This led the University of Sindh to start B.Sc. and M.Sc. Electronics Programmemes in 1979 under the umbrella of the Institute of physics and technology (IPT). The IPT was pioneer in Sindh province to provide training and educating the individuals to harness the full potential of the discipline<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2" style="display: none;"> Later, the IPT was bifurcated to the Institute of information technology (IIT) in 1998. The department of Electronics started to offer 4 years BS degree in electrics in 2002. Later the nomenclature of the Institute was re-designated as Institute of Information and Communication Technology (IICT). In 2020 IICT was upgraded to the Faculty of Engineering and Technology (FET) to extend its scope in the field of engineering and technology. As a result of this the nomenclature of Department of Electronic was changed to Department of Electronic Engineering (DEE) and got accredited by the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC). DEE also offers M.E in Electronic engineering under the shelter of DR. A. H. S. Bukhari Institute of Information and Communication Technology.</span>
